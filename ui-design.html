            <p>
                I created several user interface mock-ups in Interface Design I & II classes at WCC. I will have a page that displays these projects as either tiles or a carousel. Each project will consist of a JPG image of the the mockup and the context for the assignment.

            <h2>Panache Bridal Mood Board and Index Page</h2>
            <p>
                I was paired up with another student and we were given the challenge of using the color green and the theme of outer space to incorporate into our design. He and I had to take a different approach to the color and theme. Since aliens and spaceships didn't seem suitable for a high-end Southern California bridal store, I took inspiration from the ancient mariners who gazed up at the stars.

                A dominant photo style index page redesign of a company whose name I pulled from the instructorâ€™s envelope of possibilities. The target user was a young bride seeking wedding decor and gifts for her bridal party.

            <h2>Market Basket Grocery Store</h2>
            <p>
                This assignment was a three-bucket index page redesign plus two advertising layouts; the instructor provided the text and I found the imagery. After three, weekly design critiques I was able to hone in on the patterning that evokes the weave of basketry.

            <h2>Affordable Tours</h2>
            <p>
                Another student and I were paired up to tackle this long-and-flat index page redesign. We were required to research current travel websites to find common styles for the industry, then each pick a different approach for the Affordable Tours website. I was able to create my mockup using photos from my travels.
