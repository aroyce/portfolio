            <p>
                I created several user interface mock-ups during two interface design classes at WCC. The instructor would typically provide the company name and require a specific page layout style. Progress was evaluated with a design critique in front of the class each week.

            <h2>Panache Bridal Mood Board and Index Page</h2>
            <p>
                I was paired up with another student and we were given the challenge of using the color green and the theme of outer space to incorporate into our design. He and I had to take a different approach to the color and theme. Since aliens and spaceships didn't seem suitable for a high-end Southern California bridal store, I took inspiration from the ancient mariners who gazed up at the stars.

                This assignment was a three-bucket index page redesign; the instructor provided the text and I found the imagery. After three weekly design critiques, I honed in on a pattern that evokes the weave of basketry.

            <p>
                Another student and I tackled this long-and-flat index page redesign. We were required to research current travel websites to find common styles for the industry, then each pick a different approach for the Affordable Tours website. I created my mockup with photos from my travels.
